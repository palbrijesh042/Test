    Blockquotes
    <!-- If a section of block level content (be it a paragraph, multiple paragraphs, a list, etc.) 
  is quoted from somewhere else, you should wrap it inside a <blockquote> element to signify this, 
    and include a URL pointing to the source of the quote inside a cite attribute. For example,
   the following markup is taken from the MDN <blockquote> element page: -->
    <p>
      The <strong>HTML <code>&lt;blockquote&gt;</code> Element</strong> (or
      <em>HTML Block Quotation Element</em>) indicates that the enclosed text is
      an extended quotation.
    </p>
    <!-- it gives the space at starting -->
    <p>Here is a blockquote:</p>
    <blockquote
      cite="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/blockquote"
    >
      <p>
        The <strong>HTML <code>&lt;blockquote&gt;</code> Element</strong> (or
        <em>HTML Block Quotation Element</em>) indicates that the enclosed text
        is an extended quotation.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <!-- Inline quotations work in exactly the same way, except that they use the
   <q> element. For example, 
  the below bit of markup contains a quotation from the MDN <q> page: -->
    <p>
      The quote element — <code>&lt;q&gt;</code> — is
      <q cite="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/q">
        intended for short quotations that don't require paragraph breaks.

    <!-- You will occasionally need to use superscript and subscript 
    when marking up items like dates, chemical formulae, and mathematical 
    equations so they have the correct meaning. 
    The <sup> and <sub> elements handle this job. For example: -->
    <p>My birthday is on the 25<sup>th</sup> of May 2001.</p>
    <p>
      Caffeine's chemical formula is
      C<sub>8</sub>H<sub>10</sub>N<sub>4</sub>O<sub>2</sub>.

    <!-- Representing computer code
There are a number of elements available for marking up computer code using HTML:

<code>: For marking up generic pieces of computer code.
<pre>: For retaining whitespace (generally code blocks) — if you use indentation or excess whitespace inside your text, browsers will ignore it and you will not see it on your rendered page. If you wrap the text in <pre></pre> tags however, your whitespace will be rendered identically to how you see it in your text editor.
<var>: For specifically marking up variable names.
<kbd>: For marking up keyboard (and other types of) input entered into the computer.
<samp>: For marking up the output of a computer program.
Let's look at examples of these elements and how they're used to represent computer code. If you want to see the full file, take a look at the other-semantics.html sample file. You can download the file and open it in your browser to see for yourself, but here is a snippet of the code: -->
    <pre><code>const para = document.querySelector('p');

  para.onclick = function() {
    alert('Owww, stop poking me!');
  }</code></pre>

    <p>
      You shouldn't use presentational elements like
      <code>&lt;font&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;center&gt;</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the above JavaScript example, <var>para</var> represents a paragraph
      element.
    </p>

    <p>
      Select all the text with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>/<kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>A</kbd>.
    </p>
